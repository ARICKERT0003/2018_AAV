ok, lets assume 'makeBuild' works on other peoples computers. 

How to get it to work:
1) Place 'makebuild' in the folder with 'src' and 'cmake.txt'
2) open terminal
3) type "./makeBuild"
4) you should see a folder "build001" appear with your current build

assuming'makeBuild' doesn't work on other peoples computers.

How to get it to work:
1) Place 'MakeBuild.cpp' in the folder with 'src' and 'cmake.txt'
2) open terminal
3) type "g++ -std=c++11 -w MakeBuild.cpp -o makebuild"
4) skip to step 3 above.
